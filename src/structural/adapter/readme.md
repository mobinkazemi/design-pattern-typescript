# Adapter Pattern

Adapter pattern uses in situations where we have 2 different objects that are incompatible to ineract with each other. So without changing the implementation of these 2 objects, by writing an adapter, we transform the data form and structure of fist object to be compatible and recognizable for second object.

## Disadvantages

1. We have to maintain the adapter we wrote to make 2 incompatible objects adapt to each other
