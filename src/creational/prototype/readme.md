# Prototype Pattern
This pattern helps us in creating Objects. This Object gets its initial state and properties from that prototype interface. `clone()` method creates a clone Object related to that interface.

## Usage
1. When you have created some objects in your program and at the time you need another Object identical to these Objects, you want to quickly get that Object copy without creating it again that has some overloads.
